Ukraine (for international use)” were also approved, setting out the spelling rules for Ukrainian geographical names and their rendering in Latin, and information about the administrative and territorial division of Ukraine (in Ukrainian and Latin), which is available on the website of the UN Group of Experts on Geographical Names (UNGEGN).\r\n\r\nhttps://unstats.un.org/UNSD/geoinfo/UNGEGN/ungegnConf10.html",
