    "message": "chore: Convert QueryAutoRefresh to TypeScript functional React component [sc-48362] (#20179)\n\n* git commit -m 'Convert QueryAutoRefresh to functional component [sc-48362]'\r\n\r\n* addressing PR comments [sc-48362]\r\n\r\nRemoves unneeded props and state tracking of offline, adds finally block to simplify clearing pending request, simplifies value comparison in array by using includes in place of indexOf\r\n\r\n* Address PR comment to use enum for QueryState [sc-48362]\r\n\r\nOriginal implementation had string literals used in multiple places representing Query.state value options.  This commit creates a formal TypeScript enum for QueryState so we can remove string literals and ensure better consistency\r\n\r\n* Address PR comments for object type validation [sc-48362]\r\n\r\nThis commit resolves an issue why the TypeScript typing for queryList was marked as a Query[] but was actually a Dictionary (associative array) or Queries.  A new type QueryDictionary has been added and the QueryAutoRefresh code was adjusted to use QueryDictionary instead of Query[] in appropriate places as well as unit tests.  Commit also removes QueryAutoRefreshContainer by making the once component using QueryAutoRefresh (which is already redux connected) pass the needed values on props.  this simplifies the code base and reduce files that need unit testing while keeping QueryAutoRefresh out of needing a redux connection directly.\r\n\r\n* Addresses PR comment to add QueryState.SCHEDULED to runningQueryStateList [sc-48362]\r\n\r\nIn previous implementation 'scheduled' was not included int he list of Query States.  Further investigation shows it should be added to as a running state.\r\n\r\n* Fix prettier lint error [sc-48362]\r\n\r\n* Adjust unit tests for props update hoisting callbacks out of actions wrapper object [sc-48362]\r\n\r\n* Update with changes from master [sc-48362]\r\n\r\nMerges in updates from master and resolves conflicts from relocation of some of the Query TypeScript definitions into core\r\n\r\n* Removes logic setting user offline and relying on results panel error message [sc-48362]\r\n\r\n* Fixes bad import after some TypeScript definitions were relocated to core [sc-48362]\r\n\r\n* Fixes TypeScript errors [sc-48362]",
