    "message": "fix: Normalise `*.sh` File Endings (#16608)\n\nWindows users encounter problems running the `docker-compose` commands\r\n to run an instance of Superset.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this is line-endings for the `*.sh` files that are\r\n mounted and used in the `command` sections for the superset images.\r\n\r\nMany Windows users will check the repository out with line endings set\r\n to `CRLF`. When mounted in to the *nix-based containers, these line\r\n endings are not understood, leading to errors such as:\r\n\r\n```text\r\n/usr/bin/env: bash\\r: No such file or directory\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe addition of a `.gitattributes` file resolves this issue by telling\r\n git to always resolve these files with `LF` line endings.\r\n\r\n+semver: fix\r\n+ref: #10132",
