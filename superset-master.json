    "message": "Update clickhouse.mdx (#17937)\n\nThere is a contradiction on this page - the requirements show `clickhouse-sqlalchemy` and then there is this sentence stating that the recommended connector is `sqlalchemy-clickhouse`, which is somewhat of an abandoned driver that is not seeing any activity in Github. I would suggest either removing the sentence about \"recommended connector\" or changing the link (as I have done in this PR).",
