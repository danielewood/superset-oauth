  "body": "Hello Community,\r\n\r\nThe Apache Superset team is pleased to announce that Superset1.3.0 has just been released.\r\n\r\nApache Superset is a modern, enterprise-ready business intelligence web application. \r\n\r\nSuperset 1.3 focuses on hardening and polishing the superset user experience, with tons of UX improvements and bug fixes focused on charts, dashboards, and the new dashboard-native filters.\r\n\r\nOne major goal of this release is to improve and harden dashboard-native filters. These filters live at the dashboard level instead of within a chart and affect all charts under their scope within a dashboard. Improvements in this release include clearer visual indicators of what charts are within the scope of a selected filter.\r\n\r\n- The official source release: https://www.apache.org/dist/superset/1.3.0\r\n- The PyPI package: https://pypi.org/project/apache-superset/1.3.0/\r\n- Release notes: https://github.com/apache/superset/tree/master/RELEASING/release-notes-1-3\r\n\r\nIf you have any usage questions, or have problems when upgrading or\r\nfind any problems about enhancements included in this release, please\r\ndon't hesitate to let us know by sending feedback to this mailing\r\nlist.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: general-unsubscribe@apache.org\r\nFor additional commands, e-mail: general-help@apache.org",
